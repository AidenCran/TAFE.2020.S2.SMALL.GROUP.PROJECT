Save Manger
===========

### What is it's purpose?

The save manager handles reading and writing data to a text file with Json formatting
Using Json formatting means it's very easily readable for both humans and computers. However this also means the player can easily alter the data.
For this project Binary Serialization won't be used, although it would increase the security, it is unnesssary.
